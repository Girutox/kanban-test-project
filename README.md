## Installation
To get started with the Kanban App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kanban-app.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd kanban-app
  ```
3. Install the dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
4. Start the development server:
  ```bash
  ng serve
  ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.

## Environment Setup
To configure the environment variables for the Kanban App, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `.env` in a folder called `environments` in the root directory of the project.
2. Add your environment-specific variables to the `.env` file. For example:
  ```env
  FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-value
  FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-value
  FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-value
  FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-value
  ```
3. Ensure that the `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being pushed to the repository:
  ```
  .env
  ```
4. The file named `set-env.ts` inside the folder `environments` will handle the creation of the file named `environments.ts` in the same folder.

By following these steps, you can securely manage your environment variables without exposing sensitive information in your repository.

## Usage
1. Create a new board and add columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
2. Add tasks to the columns and assign them to team members.
3. Drag and drop tasks to move them between columns as work progresses.
4. Use filters and search to find specific tasks quickly.
